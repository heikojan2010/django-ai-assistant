      Summary**:\n\"Shrek\" tells the story of a reclusive and grumpy ogre named Shrek
      who finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures that have been banished
      by the evil Lord Farquaad. To regain his solitude, Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad
      to rescue Princess Fiona and bring her to him. Along the way, Shrek is accompanied
